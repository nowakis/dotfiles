Welcome to rbatista dotfiles
============================

This project contains some nice plugins for VIM and ZSH.
I use Janus to distribution of vim plugins and mapping them to VIM.
(https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

What is diferent?
-----------------

 - I disable the syntastic plugin;
 - Add a Java snippet (https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim);
 - Add File type to ident Java Programs with 4 spaces;
 - Add solarized plugin for terminal and VIM;
 - Add a fix for solarized plugin for gnome-terminal;
 - Add some shortcuts and env variables into Ubuntu profile and some
   shortcuts to personal projects (maybe this not will be util for you);

Instalation
-----------
I do an [automatic
installer](https://github.com/rbatista/dotfiles/blob/master/tools/install.sh) to make your life more easy. You can
execute this command in your terminal to automatic instalation:

```bash
$ curl -Lo- https://bit.ly/rbatista-dotfiles | bash
```

If you dont trust me, sorry!
